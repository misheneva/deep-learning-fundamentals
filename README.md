# 🧠 Fundamentals of Neural Networks Course

## 📚 About

This repository contains practical exercises for the **Fundamentals of Neural Networks** course created by **Mike Romanov**.

## 🗂️ Program

1. Getting Started with PyTorch  
2. Gradient Descent Practice  
3. Backpropagation with NumPy  
4. Building Your First Neural Network in PyTorch  

## ⚙️ Requirements

This course is designed to run inside the **Laborantum** environment. To get started, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any of its forks  
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for VS Code  
- [Laborantum](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Laborantum.laborantum) extension  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)  
- Git (to clone the repository)  

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPO>.git
cd your-repo
code .
```

Open the project folder in VS Code and allow it to open in a Dev Container when prompted.

## ✅ How to Check Your Work

The Laborantum extension includes an automated grading system that compares your solutions to the instructor's reference implementation. It runs locally inside Docker, so you don’t need internet access once everything is set up.

## 💪 Additional Resources

The course is designed to run fully on your local machine, guiding you step-by-step through building neural networks from scratch. You will be able to check whether the iterations run at all.

However, for getting the models training and achieving meaningful results, you may need access to additional compute resources. Consider using:

- Google Colab Pro
- Vast.ai
- Other cloud computing platforms
